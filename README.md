# wod-citizen
World of Darkness character and chronicle manager

This is a project that I'm using as a way to learn symfony. Expect bad coding, some errors and erratic commits.

WoD Citizen is a character and chronicle manager. Storytellers can control characters. Players make changes to their characters, and the Storyteller must approve it.
